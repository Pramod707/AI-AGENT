RL allows LLMs to optimize output based on reward feedback (human-labeled data or user engagement metrics). Fine-tuning with RL adapts LLMs to tasks like content recommendation and code generation. Reward Models assign scores to generated output, training the LLM to maximize these rewards, improving user engagement or accuracy. LLMs balance exploration (new solutions) and exploitation (known high-reward outcomes).",

        "summary_content": "The history of LLMs starts with semantics, developed by Michel Br\u00e9al in 1883. Natural language processing (NLP) translates human communications into a language understood by computers and vice versa. After WWII, NLP gained attention for language translation. Arthur Samuel of IBM developed a checkers program using machine learning in the 1950s. In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt created the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first artificial neural network. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, the first program using NLP. Early language models started development in the 1980s at IBM, predicting the next word in a sentence. Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989, enabling LLMs to access massive data. GPUs and deep learning advanced LLMs in the 1990s. In 2014, Ian Goodfellow introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022.",
