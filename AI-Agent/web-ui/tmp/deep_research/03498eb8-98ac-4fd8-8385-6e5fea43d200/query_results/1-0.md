This area of research experienced a surge of interest in 2018 with the proposal of BERT \\[10\\], which demonstrated that the transformer architecture, self-supervised pretraining, and supervised transfer learning form a powerful combination. In fact, BERT set new state-of-the-art performance on every benchmark on which it was applied at the time. Although BERT could not be used for generative tasks, we saw with the proposal of [T5](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/t5-text-to-text-transformers-part) \\[11\\] that supervised transfer learning was effective in this domain as well. Despite these accomplishments, however, such models pale in comparison to the generative capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4 that we have today. To create a model like this, we need training techniques that go far beyond supervised learning. > “Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” _— OpenAI_ [_Founding Statement_](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai) _(Dec. 2015)_ [](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Ftowards-data-science%2F16dfac9e4a45&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Ftowards-data-science%2Fthe-story-of-rlhf-origins-motivations-techniques-and-modern-applications-16dfac9e4a45&user=Cameron+R.+Wolfe%2C+Ph.D.&userId=28aa6026c553&source=---footer_actions--16dfac9e4a45---------------------clap_footer------------------) \\-- [](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Ftowards-data-science%2F16dfac9e4a45&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Ftowards-data-science%2Fthe-story-of-rlhf-origins-motivations-techniques-and-modern-applications-16dfac9e4a45&user=Cameron+R.+Wolfe%2C+Ph.D.&userId=28aa6026c553&source=---footer_actions--16dfac9e4a45---------------------clap_footer------------------) \\-- [](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F16dfac9e4a45&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Ftowards-data-science%2Fthe-story-of-rlhf-origins-motivations-techniques-and-modern-applications-16dfac9e4a45&source=---footer_actions--16dfac9e4a45---------------------bookmark_footer------------------) [![Image 8: TDS Archive](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science?source=post_page---post_publication_info--16dfac9e4a45---------------------------------------) [![Image 9: TDS Archive](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science?source=post_page---post_publication_info--16dfac9e4a45---------------------------------------) Follow [Published in TDS Archive ------------------------](https://medium.com/towards-data-science?source=post_page---post_publication_info--16dfac9e4a45---------------------------------------) [808K Followers](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/followers?source=post_page---post_publication_info--16dfac9e4a45---------------------------------------) ·[Last published Feb 3, 2025](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/diy-ai-how-to-build-a-linear-regression-model-from-scratch-7b4cc0efd235?source=post_page---post_publication_info--16dfac9e4a45---------------------------------------) An archive of data science, data analytics, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence writing from the former Towards Data Science Medium publication.

walking into the Library of Alexandria, one of the largest and most important
libraries of the ancient world, filled with countless scrolls and books
representing the accumulated knowledge of the entire human race. It’s like
being transported into a world of endless learning, where you could spend
entire lifetimes poring over the insights of the greats in every field – from
astronomy to mathematics to chemistry. Now imagine being able to wield the
power of the Library of Alexandria at your fingertips. It is a mind-boggling
achievement that would appear absolutely magical to someone who lived even 100
years ago. That’s the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), the modern
equivalent of this legendary library. They can answer questions, summarize
entire books, translate and contextualize text from multiple languages, and
solve complex equations. They’re also at your beck and call when you need some
motivational poetry on a Monday morning. ![Image 1: ChatGPT

"What Does the Future of Large Language Models Look Like?") What is a Large
Language Model? ------------------------------- A large language model, or
LLM, is a neural network with billions of parameters trained on vast amounts
of unlabeled text using [self-supervised or semi-supervised
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning). These
general-purpose models are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, from
sentiment analysis to mathematical reasoning. Despite being trained on simple
tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence, LLMs can capture much of
the structure and meaning of human language. They also have a remarkable
amount of general knowledge about the world and can “memorize” an enormous
number of facts during training. Think of LLMs as giant, flexible brains that
can be taught to do almost anything, provided they have access to enough data
and processing power. So, the next time you ask ChatGPT a question, just
remember: you’re interacting with one of the most impressive pieces of AI
technology in existence. ### History of Large Language Models ![Image 2:
History of Large Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-02-1024x576.jpg) LLMs have a fascinating
history that dates back to the 1960s with the creation of [the first-ever
chatbot, Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Designed by MIT
researcher Joseph Weizenbaum, Eliza was a simple program that used pattern
recognition to simulate human conversation by turning the user’s input into a
question and generating a response based on a set of pre-defined rules. Though
Eliza was far from perfect, it marked the beginning of research into natural
language processing (NLP) and the development of more sophisticated LLMs. Over
the years, several significant innovations have propelled the field of LLMs
forward. One such innovation was the introduction of [Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM)](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) networks in
1997, which allowed for the creation of deeper and more complex neural
networks capable of handling more significant amounts of data. Another pivotal
moment came with [Stanford’s CoreNLP
suite](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), which was introduced in 2010.
The suite provided a set of tools and algorithms that helped researchers
tackle complex NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity
recognition. In 2011, [Google
Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) was launched, providing
researchers with access to powerful computing resources and data sets along
with advanced features such as word embeddings, allowing NLP systems to better
understand the context of words. Google Brain’s work paved the way for massive
advancements in the field, such as the introduction of [Transformer
models](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-
network.html) in 2017. The transformer architecture enabled the creation of
larger and more sophisticated LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre-
Trained Transformer) which served as the foundation for ChatGPT and a legion
of other incredible AI-driven applications. In recent years, solutions such as
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and
[BARD](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/) have
also contributed significantly to the advancement of LLMs by creating user-
friendly frameworks and tools that enable researchers and developers to build
their own LLMs. ### Types of Large Language Models ![Image 3: Types of Large
Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-03-1-1024x410.jpg) Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be broadly classified into three types – pre-training models, fine-
tuning models, and multimodal models. * **Pre-training models** like
[GPT-3/GPT-3.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3),
[T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-
with-t5.html), and [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) are trained on
vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn a wide range of language patterns
and structures. These models excel at generating coherent and grammatically
correct text on a variety of topics. They are used as a starting point for
further training and fine-tuning for specific tasks. * **Fine-tuning models**
like [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-
pre.html), [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), and
[ALBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942) are pre-trained on a large dataset
and then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a specific task. These models are
highly effective for tasks like sentiment analysis, question-answering, and
text classification. They are often used in industrial applications where
there is a need for task-specific language models. * **Multimodal models**
like [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip/) and
[DALL-E](https://openai.com/research/dall-e) combine text with other
modalities like images or video to create more robust language models. These
models can understand the relationships between images and text, allowing them
to generate text descriptions of images or even generate images from textual
descriptions. Each type of LLM has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and
the choice of which one to use depends on the specific use case. ###
Applications of Large Language Models ![Image 4: Applications of Large
Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-05-1-1024x777.jpg) Large Language Models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. In this section, we will explore some of the
most significant applications of LLMs. * **Evolving Conversational AI:** LLMs
have shown impressive results in conversational AI, where they can generate
responses that are not only contextually relevant but also maintain coherence
throughout the dialogue. The widespread adoption of chatbots and virtual
assistants is a testament to the growing use of LLMs. A study by Google
researchers in 2020 found that their LLM, [Meena, outperformed all other
dialogue agents](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-
agent-that-can.html) in a human evaluation of sensibleness and response
quality, achieving a score of 79% compared to the next-best agent’s score of
56%. Meena was trained with 2.6 billion parameters on a massive 341 GB dataset
of social media conversations and can engage in a wide range of topics, making
it an impressive example of how LLMs are pushing the boundaries of
conversational AI. LLMs are also being used to improve the accuracy of speech
recognition systems, which are essential for many conversational AI
applications. * **Textual Content Creation:** LLMs have proven to be useful in
generating text in various forms, such as news articles, product descriptions,
and even creative writing. GPT-3, for example, has shown impressive results in
generating coherent and creative text. The technology has the potential to
revolutionize content creation and reduce the time and resources required to
produce quality content. * **Understanding sentiments within the text:**
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify and extract subjective
information from text, such as emotions, opinions, and attitudes. LLMs have
been shown to perform well in sentiment analysis tasks, with applications in
customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and social media analysis. In
2020, OpenAI tested GPT-3 on a dataset of tweets related to the COVID-19
pandemic. The model was able to accurately identify the sentiment of each
tweet, whether it was positive, negative, or neutral. This kind of analysis
can help public health officials understand how people are feeling about the
pandemic and respond accordingly. In 2022, researchers from Google and The
Ohio State University published a paper that showed that LLMs were remarkably
accurate at deriving [insights about financial
markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11311.pdf) by analyzing Twitter and Reddit
threads. * **Efficient Machine Translation:** The traditional approach to
machine translation involved rule-based systems that required a lot of human
input to develop complex sets of linguistic rules. But with the advent of
LLMs, translation systems are becoming more efficient and accurate. One of the
most remarkable examples of LLMs being used for translation is Google
Translate. Google has been using [neural machine translation (NMT)
models](https://research.google/pubs/pub45610/) powered by LLMs since 2016.
Google Translate’s system has proven to be remarkably effective, producing
close to [human quality translations for over 100
languages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJQLMj8O5z3Q7eKDxi1tNNrFipiEL0UDyaEF0fleZ54/edit#gid=0).
By breaking down these language barriers, LLMs are making it possible for
humans all over the world to share knowledge and communicate with each other
in a way that was previously impossible. [ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter
Plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter) represents
yet another step towards simplifying human-to-machine communication by making
it possible for developers and non-coders alike to build applications by
offering instructions in simple English. ### The Limitations of Current-Gen
LLMs ![Image 5: The Limitations of Current-Gen
LLMs](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Limitations-
of-Current-Gen-LLMs-1024x643.jpg) * **Ethical and privacy concerns:** Large
datasets may contain sensitive information that can be used to identify
individuals or groups, and currently, there are very few regulatory frameworks
to ensure that this information is handled ethically. For example, OpenAI’s
GPT-3 was trained on billions of words from various sources including Common
Crawl, WebText, books, and Wikipedia, raising ethical concerns over the fair
use of intellectual property by authors and researchers. Obtaining explicit
permission from copyright holders, especially in fine-tuning models, is
necessary to avoid legal issues. Obtaining consent for the use of data from
deceased individuals such as older authors poses an additional challenge as
permission cannot be obtained. * **Biases and fairness problems:** Another
issue with large language models is the potential for cultural and regional
biases to be amplified. Because these models are trained on large amounts of
text data from the internet, they may inadvertently learn and reinforce biases
present in that data, such as gender, racial, or geographic biases. This
phenomenon was demonstrated in a 2016 study which showed that popular word
embedding models trained on large text datasets were capable of encoding
gender stereotypes, such as associating words like “programmer” and “engineer”
more strongly with men than women. These biases have real-world consequences,
particularly in applications such as hiring or lending decisions, where biased
outputs from a language model could lead to unfair treatment. * **Carbon
footprints and massive computational costs:** LLMs require vast amounts of
computational power to train, which can have a significant impact on energy
consumption and carbon emissions. In addition, training and deploying LLMs can
be prohibitively expensive for many organizations, particularly smaller
companies, or academic institutions. It is estimated that training OpenAi’s
GPT-3 model from scratch would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.6
million in cloud computing resources alone, not to mention the carbon
footprint of such a massive endeavor. ### What Does the Future of Large
Language Models Look Like? Even with the exponential rate of advancements in
the field of AI, we are still quite far away from the end state or the “event
horizon” of LLMs. While ChatGPT is undoubtedly impressive, it only represents
an intermediary step to what’s coming next. The future of LLMs is fluid and
unpredictable, but here are some trends that we see shaping the trajectory of
these models in the years to come. 1. **Autonomous models that generate
training data to improve their performance:** Today’s LLMs use the vast
cumulative reserves of written knowledge (Wikipedia, articles, books) to train
themselves. But what if these models were to utilize all of their training to
produce new content and then use it as additional training data to improve
themselves? When you consider that [we may soon run out of input data for
LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325.pdf), auto-generation of training
content is an approach that several researchers are already working towards.
Recently, [Google built an LLM that generates its own questions and
answers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11610.pdf), filters the output for the
highest quality content, and then fine-tunes itself on the curated responses.
[Another study focused on instruction fine-
tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10560.pdf), a core LLM method, and built a
model that generates its own natural language instructions, then fine-tunes
itself on those instructions. This method improved the performance of the
GPT-3 model by 33%, nearly matching the performance of OpenAI’s own
instruction-tuned model. Additionally, [a related
study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01296.pdf) found that large language models
which first recite what they know about a topic before responding provide more
accurate and sophisticated answers, much like how humans take time to reflect
before sharing their perspectives in a conversation. 2. **Models that can
validate their own information:** The current iteration of LLMs can never
fully replace something like a Google search. While these models are
incredibly powerful, [they regularly generate misleading or inaccurate
information and present it as
facts.](https://twitter.com/haus_cole/status/1598357898861907968?s=20&t=e7yeLxqan7nwLy0eBpPtKg)
For an LLM-based search engine to truly thrive, even a 99% accuracy rate is
simply not good enough. To remedy this, LLMs can increase transparency and
trust by providing references to the source(s) of information they retrieve.
This allows users to audit information for reliability. Key early models in
this area include [Google’s REALM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08909.pdf) and
[Facebook’s RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-
streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/).
With the increase in the use of conversational LLMs, researchers are working
feverishly to build more reliable models. [OpenAI’s
WebGPT](https://openai.com/research/webgpt), a fine-tuned version of its GPT
model, can browse the internet using Bing to provide more accurate and in-
depth responses with citations that can be audited by humans. 3. **Rise of
Sparse Expert Models:** The most popular LLMs of today – GPT-3,
[LaMDA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239), [Megatron-
Turing](https://developer.nvidia.com/megatron-turing-natural-language-
generation), and others – all share the same basic structure. They are dense,
self-supervised, pre-trained models based on the transformer architecture. In
this context, “_dense_” means that the model uses every single one of its
parameters for each query. If you ask GPT-3 something, the model uses all 175
billion of its parameters to provide an answer. But momentum is building
behind a different approach to LLM architectures – [sparse expert
models.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01667.pdf) Simply put, sparse expert
models are built on the idea that only the parameters that are relevant to a
query need to be activated to produce the output. As a result, these models
can be much larger, more complex, and yet significantly less resource-heavy
than our current dense models. [Google’s GLaM
model](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/more-efficient-in-context-learning-
with.html), for example, is 7x the size of GPT-3, requires significantly less
energy and computation for training, and performs better than GPT-3 in a
variety of language tasks. The development of LLMs is a rapidly evolving field
with new breakthroughs and discoveries emerging all the time. While it is
difficult to predict exactly where this technology will lead us, one thing is
clear: LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and
work with language in ways that we can’t yet imagine.

"What Does the Future of Large Language Models Look Like?") What is a Large
Language Model? ------------------------------- A large language model, or
LLM, is a neural network with billions of parameters trained on vast amounts
of unlabeled text using [self-supervised or semi-supervised
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning). These
general-purpose models are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks, from
sentiment analysis to mathematical reasoning. Despite being trained on simple
tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence, LLMs can capture much of
the structure and meaning of human language. They also have a remarkable
amount of general knowledge about the world and can “memorize” an enormous
number of facts during training. Think of LLMs as giant, flexible brains that
can be taught to do almost anything, provided they have access to enough data
and processing power. So, the next time you ask ChatGPT a question, just
remember: you’re interacting with one of the most impressive pieces of AI
technology in existence. ### History of Large Language Models ![Image 2:
History of Large Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-02-1024x576.jpg) LLMs have a fascinating
history that dates back to the 1960s with the creation of [the first-ever
chatbot, Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA). Designed by MIT
researcher Joseph Weizenbaum, Eliza was a simple program that used pattern
recognition to simulate human conversation by turning the user’s input into a
question and generating a response based on a set of pre-defined rules. Though
Eliza was far from perfect, it marked the beginning of research into natural
language processing (NLP) and the development of more sophisticated LLMs. Over
the years, several significant innovations have propelled the field of LLMs
forward. One such innovation was the introduction of [Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM)](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) networks in
1997, which allowed for the creation of deeper and more complex neural
networks capable of handling more significant amounts of data. Another pivotal
moment came with [Stanford’s CoreNLP
suite](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), which was introduced in 2010.
The suite provided a set of tools and algorithms that helped researchers
tackle complex NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity
recognition. In 2011, [Google
Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) was launched, providing
researchers with access to powerful computing resources and data sets along
with advanced features such as word embeddings, allowing NLP systems to better
understand the context of words. Google Brain’s work paved the way for massive
advancements in the field, such as the introduction of [Transformer
models](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-
network.html) in 2017. The transformer architecture enabled the creation of
larger and more sophisticated LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre-
Trained Transformer) which served as the foundation for ChatGPT and a legion
of other incredible AI-driven applications. In recent years, solutions such as
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and
[BARD](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/) have
also contributed significantly to the advancement of LLMs by creating user-
friendly frameworks and tools that enable researchers and developers to build
their own LLMs. ### Types of Large Language Models ![Image 3: Types of Large
Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-03-1-1024x410.jpg) Large Language Models
(LLMs) can be broadly classified into three types – pre-training models, fine-
tuning models, and multimodal models. * **Pre-training models** like
[GPT-3/GPT-3.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3),
[T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-
with-t5.html), and [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) are trained on
vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn a wide range of language patterns
and structures. These models excel at generating coherent and grammatically
correct text on a variety of topics. They are used as a starting point for
further training and fine-tuning for specific tasks. * **Fine-tuning models**
like [BERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-
pre.html), [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), and
[ALBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942) are pre-trained on a large dataset
and then fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a specific task. These models are
highly effective for tasks like sentiment analysis, question-answering, and
text classification. They are often used in industrial applications where
there is a need for task-specific language models. * **Multimodal models**
like [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip/) and
[DALL-E](https://openai.com/research/dall-e) combine text with other
modalities like images or video to create more robust language models. These
models can understand the relationships between images and text, allowing them
to generate text descriptions of images or even generate images from textual
descriptions. Each type of LLM has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and
the choice of which one to use depends on the specific use case. ###
Applications of Large Language Models ![Image 4: Applications of Large
Language Models](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/LLL_Evolution-05-1-1024x777.jpg) Large Language Models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. In this section, we will explore some of the
most significant applications of LLMs. * **Evolving Conversational AI:** LLMs
have shown impressive results in conversational AI, where they can generate
responses that are not only contextually relevant but also maintain coherence
throughout the dialogue. The widespread adoption of chatbots and virtual
assistants is a testament to the growing use of LLMs. A study by Google
researchers in 2020 found that their LLM, [Meena, outperformed all other
dialogue agents](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-
agent-that-can.html) in a human evaluation of sensibleness and response
quality, achieving a score of 79% compared to the next-best agent’s score of
56%. Meena was trained with 2.6 billion parameters on a massive 341 GB dataset
of social media conversations and can engage in a wide range of topics, making
it an impressive example of how LLMs are pushing the boundaries of
conversational AI. LLMs are also being used to improve the accuracy of speech
recognition systems, which are essential for many conversational AI
applications. * **Textual Content Creation:** LLMs have proven to be useful in
generating text in various forms, such as news articles, product descriptions,
and even creative writing. GPT-3, for example, has shown impressive results in
generating coherent and creative text. The technology has the potential to
revolutionize content creation and reduce the time and resources required to
produce quality content. * **Understanding sentiments within the text:**
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify and extract subjective
information from text, such as emotions, opinions, and attitudes. LLMs have
been shown to perform well in sentiment analysis tasks, with applications in
customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and social media analysis. In
2020, OpenAI tested GPT-3 on a dataset of tweets related to the COVID-19
pandemic. The model was able to accurately identify the sentiment of each
tweet, whether it was positive, negative, or neutral. This kind of analysis
can help public health officials understand how people are feeling about the
pandemic and respond accordingly. In 2022, researchers from Google and The
Ohio State University published a paper that showed that LLMs were remarkably
accurate at deriving [insights about financial
markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11311.pdf) by analyzing Twitter and Reddit
threads. * **Efficient Machine Translation:** The traditional approach to
machine translation involved rule-based systems that required a lot of human
input to develop complex sets of linguistic rules. But with the advent of
LLMs, translation systems are becoming more efficient and accurate. One of the
most remarkable examples of LLMs being used for translation is Google
Translate. Google has been using [neural machine translation (NMT)
models](https://research.google/pubs/pub45610/) powered by LLMs since 2016.
Google Translate’s system has proven to be remarkably effective, producing
close to [human quality translations for over 100
languages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJQLMj8O5z3Q7eKDxi1tNNrFipiEL0UDyaEF0fleZ54/edit#gid=0).
By breaking down these language barriers, LLMs are making it possible for
humans all over the world to share knowledge and communicate with each other
in a way that was previously impossible. [ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter
Plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter) represents
yet another step towards simplifying human-to-machine communication by making
it possible for developers and non-coders alike to build applications by
offering instructions in simple English. ### The Limitations of Current-Gen
LLMs ![Image 5: The Limitations of Current-Gen
LLMs](https://www.scribbledata.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Limitations-
of-Current-Gen-LLMs-1024x643.jpg) * **Ethical and privacy concerns:** Large
datasets may contain sensitive information that can be used to identify
individuals or groups, and currently, there are very few regulatory frameworks
to ensure that this information is handled ethically. For example, OpenAI’s
GPT-3 was trained on billions of words from various sources including Common
Crawl, WebText, books, and Wikipedia, raising ethical concerns over the fair
use of intellectual property by authors and researchers. Obtaining explicit
permission from copyright holders, especially in fine-tuning models, is
necessary to avoid legal issues. Obtaining consent for the use of data from
deceased individuals such as older authors poses an additional challenge as
permission cannot be obtained. * **Biases and fairness problems:** Another
issue with large language models is the potential for cultural and regional
biases to be amplified. Because these models are trained on large amounts of
text data from the internet, they may inadvertently learn and reinforce biases
present in that data, such as gender, racial, or geographic biases. This
phenomenon was demonstrated in a 2016 study which showed that popular word
embedding models trained on large text datasets were capable of encoding
gender stereotypes, such as associating words like “programmer” and “engineer”
more strongly with men than women. These biases have real-world consequences,
particularly in applications such as hiring or lending decisions, where biased
outputs from a language model could lead to unfair treatment. * **Carbon
footprints and massive computational costs:** LLMs require vast amounts of
computational power to train, which can have a significant impact on energy
consumption and carbon emissions. In addition, training and deploying LLMs can
be prohibitively expensive for many organizations, particularly smaller
companies, or academic institutions. It is estimated that training OpenAi’s
GPT-3 model from scratch would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $4.6
million in cloud computing resources alone, not to mention the carbon
footprint of such a massive endeavor. ### What Does the Future of Large
Language Models Look Like? Even with the exponential rate of advancements in
the field of AI, we are still quite far away from the end state or the “event
